This application contains the solution to the following problems:

###2.Consider the following problem:

Write a C/C++ or Java program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
For multiple numbers simultaneously of 3 and 5, print "FooBaa", instead of the number.

Your solution should be using as few lines of code as possible, but you should produce efficient code.

###3.Consider a string containing lowercase characters from the Portuguese alphabet. You can perform two types of operations on this string:
1. Concat a lowercase character from the Portuguese alphabet at the end of the string.
2. Remove the last character from the string. If the string is empty, it will remain empty.

Given an integer k and two strings s and t, determine if you can convert s to t using exactly k operations described above on s. If possible, the program prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.

For example, string s = [a, b, c] and string t = [d, e, f]. The number of moves k = 6. To convert s to t, we first remove all characters using 3 moves. Then we concatenate each of the characters of t in the order. In the sixth move, you will have the expected string s. If more movements are available than necessary, they can be eliminated by performing multiple removals on an empty string. If there are fewer movements, it would not be possible to create the new string.

Develop a C/C++ or Java language program that implements and uses the ConcatRemove (s, t, k) function. It should return the results 'yes' or 'no'.
The function has the following parameters:\
s: starting string\
t: desired string\
k: an integer that represents the number of operations

Input format\
The first line contains the string s, the starting string.
The second line contains the string t, the desired string.
The third line contains an integer k, the number of operations.

Constrains\
a) 1 <= | s | <= 100\
b) 1 <= | t | <= 100\
c) 1 <= k <= 100\
d) s and t consists of lowercase letters of the Portuguese alphabet, ascii [a-z]

Output format
Print 'yes' if you can get the string t by executing exactly k operations on the string s, and print 'no' otherwise.

####Example 1
bla bla bla bla\
blablabcde\
8\
yes

Explanation
It took 5 operations to reduce the string "blablablabla" to "blablab". Then, 3 concatenation operations (c, d, e) were needed to obtain the string "blablabcde".
In this way, as it was possible to convert s to t using exactly k = 8 operations, the program printed "yes".

####Example 2
tab\
tab\
7\
yes

Explanation
It took 4 operations to reduce the string s (remember that a removal operation on an empty string, keeps the string empty). Then, 3 concatenation operations were performed (a, b, a). Since it was possible to convert s to t using exactly k = 7 operations, the prog

###9.Make a program in C/C++ or Java language that calculates the length of a string informed by the user (do not use any pre-existing function or method for this, such as len(), count(), strlen() or lenght());

###10.Make a program in C/C++ or Java language that reverses a string informed by the user without using any temporary variable, buffer or any pre-existing function or method for this.
